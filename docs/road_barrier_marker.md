# Road, Barrier & Marker

Utility buildings — walkable paths, defensive walls, and inter-unit communication.

---

## Road

Walkable tiles for builder bots to move on. The cheapest building.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| HP | 10 |
| Base cost | 1 Ti |
| Scaling | 0.5% |

---

## Barrier

Cheap, takes up space, and has high HP. Useful for blocking enemy paths or protecting key buildings.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| HP | 30 |
| Base cost | 3 Ti |
| Scaling | 1% |

---

## Marker

A tile containing a single **unsigned 32-bit integer** that can be read by any allied unit. Building a marker is completely free and does **not** cost action cooldown — you may place at most one marker per round.

Any team may build over markers, destroying them.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| HP | 1 |
| Cost | Free |

> **Note:** Markers are the **only form of communication** between allied units. Global variables are not shared between `Player` instances — each unit has its own isolated Python environment.

> **Tip:** All units (core, builder bots, and turrets) can place markers — not just builder bots.
```python
# Write a value to a marker
if c.can_place_marker(pos):
    c.place_marker(pos, 42)

# Read a marker
building_id = c.get_tile_building_id(pos)
if building_id is not None:
    if c.get_entity_type(building_id) == EntityType.MARKER:
        value = c.get_marker_value(building_id)
```

### Communication Patterns

Since each unit's `Player` instance is isolated, markers are essential for coordination:

- **Scouting reports**: Write enemy positions to markers near your core
- **Build orders**: Use marker values as state machine flags
- **Territory claims**: Mark tiles to avoid duplicate work
